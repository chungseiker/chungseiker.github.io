###Work Experience
----------
####**Web Front-End Engineer**, Lunit Inc.
- _Aug. 2021 - Present_
- Working as a TRP (Technical Research Personnel) for fulfilling military service.
- Developing an annotation tool and a back office console for pathologists to better-annotate cancer cells and tissues from large-scale slide images, thus improving cancer prediction quality of artificial intelligence models.
  	- Improved the rendering performance of the annotation tool up to 4.2x faster with optimizing Redux action dispatches and custom hooks ([Blog article](https://blog.seiker.kr/react-component-rerendering-optimization/)).
	- Migrated the default bundler of the annotation tool from create-react-app to Vite.js, resulting in up to 2x faster production bundling performance ([Blog article](https://blog.seiker.kr/vite-migration-from-create-react-app/)).
